# Streamlining Case Management in SF


## Background
San Francisco's case managers and housing counselors are facing critical challenges: overwhelming caseloads, inadequate staffing, and an inefficient distribution of resources. They navigate a labyrinth of services to aid those in need, often hindered by outdated databases and manual processes.

## Challenge
Create a solution leveraging Language Models that automates the identification and matching of client needs to appropriate public benefits and services. The goal is to reduce the manual workload of case managers, housing counselors, and others in the government whose job it is to help people access the government services they need, enabling them to assist more clients effectively.

## Impact
Enhanced efficiency in public service delivery, reduced burnout among case workers, and improved outcomes for those seeking assistance.
